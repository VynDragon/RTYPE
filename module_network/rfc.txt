1. Introduction

	This protocol is intended to provide the communication system
	for a R-TYPE style game for the R-TYPE project of the Epitech 
	School. It is to be used between the clients and servers  
	computers. The clients and servers are typically Personal
	Computers.

2. Packet Format

	A Interbus Communication Protocol packet, transmitted trough the UDP
	protocol, must follow the following format:

	------------------------------------------------------
	| 8 Bit identifier                                   |
	|----------------------------------------------------|
	| 16 Bit data size                                   |
	|----------------------------------------------------|
	| Data (maximum 65535 bytes, minus the ipv4, udp, and|
	| Interbus Communication Protocol headers size)      |
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	The identifier can take three value:
	
	- 0 is an ACK packet, which must be sent the client back to the
	emitter of a packet which identifier value is 2. This packet
	data size bits are set to zero, and its data is inexistant.

	- 1 is a normal packet, which do not warrant any special action
	when received.

	- 2 is an important packet, which trigger the sending of an ACK
	packet by the recipient. If the sender of this kind of packet
	does not receive an ACK as a return after an 
	implementation-designed time, it must send the packet again.
	
	- 3 is a disconnection package. The client is signaling the
	server is won't send any more package and is to be considered
	disconnected. this packet data size bits are set to zero, and
	its data is inexistant.
	
3. Session Management

	When a server receive the connection of a new client, it must
	keep track of its connection status.
	
	When a new client send a packet through UDP, it is considered
	connected.
	
	When sending important packets, if the ACK package is not
	received after an implementation-designed number of retries, the
	client is considered disconnected.
	
	When a disconnection package is received, the client is
	considered disconnected.
	
	When a client is connected, packet can be sent to it by the
	server.
	
	When a client is disconnected, messages mustn't be sent to it by
	the server.
